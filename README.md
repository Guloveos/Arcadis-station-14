Space Station 14 Rimworld Edition is a fork of Space Station 14, with a focus on sci-fi colony sim, crafting, mining and exploration instead of Space Station 14's round-to-round destructive chaos.

SS14-Rimworld-Edition is still early in development; please wait if you wish to see more content, or better, help code the game yourself. Like the main game, all code added to Rimworld Edition is under the same license as the main Space Station 14 repo. All audio and image assets unique to SS14-Rimworld-Edition are ideally to be licensed under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0, if possible.

Space Station 14 Rimworld Edition is intendent to become a game mode of Space Station 14 when hosting, requiring no extra effort on the player's part to join. RobustToolbox, Space Station 14's game engine, permits modifying everything contained within the Content packages. You are encouraged to fork and modify Space Station 14 (and by extension Space Station 14 Rimworld Edition) to suit your goals.
