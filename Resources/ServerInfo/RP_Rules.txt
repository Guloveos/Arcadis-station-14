This is a Wizard's Den server, one of the official Space Station 14 servers. If you are banned on this server, you will be banned on all official servers.

This is a roleplay server, meaning that roleplay rules apply. [color=#ff0000]This is also a medium roleplay (MRP) server, meaning that MRP Amendments do apply.[/color]

You can find a list of rules at [color=#a4885c]https://wiki.ss14.io/wiki/Server_Rules[/color]

Space Station 14 is not like most games. Many rules are designed to require roleplay, and not all rules are intuitive. Please take the time to read and understand the rules before you play so that you aren't surprised. Some of our rules are zero tolerance rules, meaning that a violation will result in an indefinite ban without any warning. Game admins will treat you as if you have read the rules, even if you have not.
