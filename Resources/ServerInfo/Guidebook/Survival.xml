# Survival
The life of a single person may make or break a situation if [color=#5b97bc]Medical[/color] is already swamped and under pressure.

Your [color=cyan]longevity[/color] is vital to keep yourself out of the pile of bodies waiting to be treated when [textlink="evil-doers" link="Antagonists"] rise up against the crew.

## Being Prepared
The home screen of your PDA can tell you the station you are on, the alert level and all the crew on the station.

Beyond that, one of the best things you can do is turn on your [color=cyan]suit sensors[/color], done by opening up your suit's context menu (done by pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/bold][/color]) and navigating to "Sensor" then "Coordinates".
This gives [color=#5b97bc]Medical[/color] a huge advantage towards finding you should you be mortally wounded.

You should also take a look inside your [color=cyan]survival box[/color], which starts inside of your bag. It contains:
- An [bold]emergency oxygen tank[/bold] as well as a [bold]breath mask[/bold]
- Emergency [bold]food and water[/bold]
- An [bold]emergency flare[/bold]
- An [bold]emergency medipen[/bold], which contains a live-saving dose of epinephrine

## Emergency Treatment 
In the event of a medical emergency, there are a few things you can do to help ensure your long-term survival, including:
- Using [bold]detailed examine[/bold] to see obvious wounds on yourself or others.
- Using [bold]emergency medipens[/bold] on people who are in or are about to enter critical condition.
- Applying [bold]gauze or cloth[/bold] to open wounds to stop bloodloss.
- [bold]Bed rest or sleep[/bold] if possible, as it can allow wounds to heal on their own.
- Eating [bold]carrots[/bold], if available, to heal blindness.
- Eating [bold]nutritious handmade meals[/bold] to help with minor wounds and overall health.
