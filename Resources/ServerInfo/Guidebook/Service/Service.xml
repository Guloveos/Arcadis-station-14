# Service
Service keeps the station clean, efficient and sane so that all other departments can do their jobs better and keep their staff happy. They also end up doing most of the paperwork on the station.

## Personnel
Service's staff is made up of Service Workers, Chefs, Botanists, Bartenders, Janitors, Chaplains, Clowns, Mimes, Musicians, Lawyers, Librarians and Passengers. Service is run by the Head of Personnel.

## Working Together
Service, despite being the most diverse, tends to be the most interlinked department by far. Most Service jobs require cooperation between workers. Chefs often need ingredients that only botanists can grow efficiently.
The bartender may request bananas that only clowns carry in abundance. The lawyer may need the mime to act out major crimes on station for confused clients.

A lot of collaboration is required within and without Service. Often times, Service is required by other departments, so be on your toes!
