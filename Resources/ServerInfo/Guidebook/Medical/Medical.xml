  # Medical

  [color=cyan]Medical[/color] is the department that heals people and revives the dead. They are central to a functioning Space Station, as everyone would die without them.

  Medical achieves this through a variety of means, such as [color=cyan]Topicals[/color], [color=cyan]Chemicals[/color], [color=cyan]Cloning[/color], [color=cyan]Cryogenics[/color], and more.

  ## Personnel
  [color=cyan]Medical[/color] is staffed by [color=cyan]Medical Interns[/color], [color=cyan]Medical Doctors[/color], [color=cyan]Paramedics[/color], and [color=cyan]Chemists[/color]. They all report directly to the [color=cyan]Chief Medical Officer[/color].

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingEyesHudMedical"/>
  </Box>

  Before healing anyone, ensure you have the necessary equipment.

  - [color=cyan]Medical Hud[/color]: This displays the health of other personnel above their heads. This lets you visually assess the condition of other crew members without needing to analyze them.
  - [color=cyan]Medical PDA[/color] and [color=cyan]Health Analyzer[/color]: These let you analyze the condition of a patient, listing all the kinds of and amounts of damage they have.

  ## Patient Status and Triaging

  Whenever a patient is hurt, it is your job to find out how to manage them and what approach to heal them. It always starts with accessing their needs and statuses so you can heal them properly.

  To do this, you use the [color=cyan]Medical Hud[/color] and the [color=cyan]Health Analyzer[/color].

  There are essentially six states that any person can be in:

  - [color=cyan]Alive[/color]: They are fully conscious and can move and talk. These are the lowest priority of patients unless they are bleeding, as they will survive if ignored. The [color=cyan]Medical Hud[/color] displays a colored bar above their head with a blue cross icon. A living person has under 100 total damage.
  - [color=cyan]Critical[/color]: These people are lying down and are usually gasping. They have the highest priority as they can saved with minimal effort. The [color=cyan]Medical Hud[/color] displays a red bar over their head with an exclamation point icon. A critical person has over 100 and less than 200 total damage.
  - [color=cyan]Dead[/color]: These people are clearly dead, but still have a soul. They have a medium priority, as you can still save them, but there is a timer until they start rotting. The [color=cyan]Medical Hud[/color] displays a black bar with a heart-rate icon. A dead person has over 200 total damage.
  - [color=cyan]Rotting[/color]: When inspected, it says their body is rotting. If you have [color=cyan]Cloning[/color] or [color=cyan]Cryogenics[/color], you still might be able to save them. If not, you should put them in the [color=cyan]Morgue[/color].
  - [color=cyan]Soulless[/color]: This person lacks a soul when it escaped after death. When inspected, if it says that their soul has departed or has gone catatonic, they are soulless. If you have [color=cyan]Cognizine[/color], you can give them a soul again. If they are alive, put them in Cryosleep, and if they are dead, put them in the [color=cyan]Morgue[/color].
  - [color=cyan]SSD[/color]: Patients may have a soul but still be unresponsive, meaning they have contracted Space Sleep Disorder. The only thing you can do for this patient is to put them in a chair and hope they return or put them in Cryosleep.

  ## Triaging Locations

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MedicalBed"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="StasisBed"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="EmergencyRollerBed"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CryogenicSleepUnit"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Morgue"/>
  </Box>

  Once you have accessed their needs, it is time to sort and place the patient where they belong.

  - [color=cyan]Medical Bed[/color]: This is the default bed for treating patients. There are no special effects except passive healing.
  - [color=cyan]Stasis Bed[/color]: The Stasis Bed is for dead or rapidly dying patients to stop their rotting or death. The Stasis Bed slows down metabolism, letting you focus on critical patients and giving you time to plan and prepare for reviving them.
  - [color=cyan]Roller Bed[/color]: When out in the field, it is necessary to heal people close to the action or quickly transport them back to medical.
  - [color=cyan]Cryogenic Sleep Unit[/color]: This stores SSD and soulless people. Once placed in it, they will automatically disappear, freeing their soul and role.
  - [color=cyan]Morgue[/color]: The Morgue is for dead people without souls or rotting corpses. If you leave corpses around, they will eventually explode and release poison gas.
  - [textlink="Cryopod" link="Cryogenics"]: These require setup but can do miraculous work for very hurt patients.

  ## Types of Medicine

  Before treating any patients, it is important to understand what medicines you have at your disposal.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Jug"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Defibrillator"/>
  </Box>

  - [color=cyan]Topicals[/color]: Topicals are the basic medicine that every Medical department starts with. These are applied directly to the patient, and heal a specific amount of damage per use. These should generally be reserved for dead patients, as this can get you to the point of using the [color=cyan]Defibrillator[/color].
  - [color=cyan]Chemicals[/color]: When applied through the syringe or pills, these chemicals are metabolized and heal the patient. As such, the patient must be alive or critical for it to be effective. Many kinds of afflictions can only be healed with chemicals, and chemicals are much more efficient.
  - [textlink="Cryogenics" link="Cryogenics"]: This can let you heal critical and dead patients very quickly and efficiently. This usually requires some setup and specific chemicals.

  ## Topicals

  The most basic medicines that the Medical Department has are the [color=cyan]Topicals[/color]. Even though the department starts with an excess of them, they are limited in quantity and not very efficient.

  Once Chemistry has created the [color=cyan]Chemicals[/color], these should be reserved for dead patients and emergencies.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Brutepack"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Ointment"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Gauze"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Bloodpack"/>
  </Box>

  The main Topicals that the department starts with are:

  - [color=cyan]Bruise Packs[/color]: This heals all types of brute damage.
  - [color=cyan]Ointment[/color]: This heals all burn damage.
  - [color=cyan]Gauze[/color]: This stops bleeding and heals with slash and piercing damage.
  - [color=cyan]Blood Packs[/color]: This increases the blood level and decreases blood loss damage.

  Later, many departments can collaborate with Chemistry to create [color=cyan]Advanced Topicals[/color]. These Advanced Topicals are more effective than regular ones.

  - [color=cyan]Medicated Sutures[/color]: This heals more brute damage and stops bleeding faster.
  - [color=cyan]Regenerative Mesh[/color]: This heals more burn damage.

  ## Defibrilation

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Defibrillator"/>
  </Box>

  Death is not permanent as long as you have enough [color=cyan]Topicals[/color] or [color=cyan]Cryogenics[/color].

  If you heal the dead patient to under 200 total damage, you can defibrillate them back to life!

  - Find a dead patient with under 200 total damage.
  - [color=yellow]Hold[/color] the [color=cyan]Defibrillator[/color]
  - Make sure that it is [color=yellow]charged[/color].
  - Turn it on by pressing [color=yellow][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/color].
  - Use it on the dead patient by pressing [color=yellow][keybind="Use"][/color].
  - When they come back to life, inject [color=cyan]Chemicals[/color] and use [color=cyan]Topicals[/color] to stabilize them.

  ## Chemicals

  [color=cyan]Chemicals[/color] are the most effective and versatile treatment type.

  There are many chemicals, but doctors don't need to know them all. Generally, [color=cyan]Chemists[/color] will label the Chemicals, and there is always a [textlink="Medicine Reference" link="Medicine"].

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MedkitFilled"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MedkitAdvancedFilled"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MedkitCombatFilled"/>
  </Box>

  First, at the start of every shift, there is a limited amount of medkits for dealing with severe and bizarre injuries. This limited nature means you should not waste it on trivial injuries until Chemistry has gotten all the Chemicals ready.

  These are the only ways to deal with genetic, toxin, and asphyxiation damage at the start of the shift.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Syringe"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Jug"/>
  </Box>

  You deliver Chemicals in two ways, [color=cyan]Syringe[/color] and [color=cyan]Pills[/color].

  The most common way is through the [color=cyan]Syringe[/color].

  - Make sure the patient is [color=cyan]Alive[/color] or [color=cyan]Critical[/color] and secure the appropriate [color=cyan]Chemicals[/color]. They cannot be on a Stasis Bed.

  - Hold an empty [color=cyan]Syringe[/color].
  - In the hotbar slot, ensure the mode is on [color=yellow]Draw[/color]. [italic]You can toggle between injecting and drawing by pressing [color=yellow][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/color][/italic].
  - Next, [color=yellow]Set Transfer Amount[/color]. By pressing [color=yellow][keybind="UIRightClick"][/color], you can Set Transfer Amount. Helps you avoid overdosing patients.
  - Now, [color=yellow]interact with the container[/color] (Jug, Beaker, Person, etc) that you wish to draw from.
  - After that, switch to [color=yellow]Inject[/color].

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Pill"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PillCanister"/>
  </Box>

  The less common but still seen method is [color=cyan]Pills[/color].

  - Make sure the patient is [color=cyan]Alive[/color] or [color=cyan]Critical[/color] and secure the appropriate [color=cyan]Pill Canisters[/color]. They cannot be on a Stasis Bed.

  - [color=yellow]Open[/color] the [color=cyan]Pill Canister[/color].
  - [color=yellow]Take out[/color] the [color=cyan]Pill[/color].
  - [color=yellow]Feed[/color] the [color=cyan]Pill[/color] to the patient by pressing [color=yellow][keybind="Use"][/color]. Make sure you administer the correct dosage.

  ## Cryogenics

  See the [textlink="Cryogenics" link="Cryogenics"] guidebook entry for [color=cyan]Cryogenics[/color] information.

  ## Medical Treatment

  Once a patient is triaged, it is time to begin medical treatment.

  The way that you tell what specifically is wrong with a patient is by using the [color=cyan]Medical PDA[/color] or [color=cyan]Health Analyzer[/color]. These list the kinds and amounts of damage that a patient has.

  This guidebook entry will only talk about [color=cyan]Bloodloss[/color] and [color=cyan]Overdosing[/color], as those are two things that every doctor will need to know how to deal with. The rest of the ailments and drugs required to cure them can be found in the [textlink="Medicine Reference" link="Medicine"].

  ## Bloodloss

  This is the most dangerous status for any patient. If this is left unattended, they will very quickly die.

  There are 3 parts in curing bloodloss:
  - [color=yellow]Stop[/color] the bleeding
  - [color=yellow]Restore[/color] the blood
  - [color=yellow]Cure[/color] bloodloss damage

  The first step you should always do is stop the bleeding before it gets any worse.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MedicatedSuture"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Gauze"/>
  </Box>

  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="Tranexamic Acid"/>

  - [color=cyan]Cauterize[/color]: This involves them touching a light to burn their wound closed.
  - [color=cyan]Gauze[/color]: This is the basic Topical for bleeding.
  - [color=cyan]Medicated Suture[/color]: This is an advanced Topical medicine for bleeding.
  - [color=cyan]Inaprovaline[/color]: This is the Chemical can stop bleeding.

  Then, you need to return all the blood that was lost.

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Bloodpack"/>
  </Box>
  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="Saline"/>

  - [color=cyan]Blood Packs[/color]: This is the topical medicine for bloodloss.
  - [color=cyan]Saline[/color]: This is the best chemical for blood loss.

  Finally, you can just let them be, and their bloodloss damage will decrease.

  ## Overdose

  If the patient begins overdosing, it is imperative to deal with it as soon as possible.

  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="Charcoal"/>

  The way you deal with it is by injecting Charcoal into the patient, which will neutralize all other Chemicals inside their body.
