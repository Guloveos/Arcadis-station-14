# The Captains and the Clowns
Upon creating your character, you may be intimidated by your vast range of options. It's okay to be scared. Everyone else is secretly equally as terrified.

Fear not, however, as creating a character is easy to do one step at a time.

## Choosing a Species
Most species have minor differences, which you can read about under the Species entry.
However, it's easier to get started with your first character as a human, moth, dwarf or reptilian.

This shouldn't discourage you from getting creative with your character, though! If you have a character in mind that you truly want to show the world, go for it.

This guide will assume you are creating a human, but the process is similar across all species.

## Minor Characteristics
These include:
- Age (18-29 for young, 30-59 for middle-aged, 60+ for old)
- Sex (your sprite, as seen by toggling "Show clothing")
- Pronouns (what the game will refer to you as)
- Skin color (may be a slider or RGB depending on species)
- Eye color (RGB)
- Hair color (RGB)

These are minor changes and have little effect on gameplay, being mostly cosmetic. This is what the game will tell players when they examine you. ("young man")

## Spawn Priority
Choosing between Arrivals and Cryosleep may seem arbitrary, and they mostly are. You can safely leave this on "None" until you feel more comfortable finding your way around the stations.

## Hair and Facial Hair
Again, you may be intimidated by the vast range of options. That's okay.

Take your time with it, you can skim or click through each of the options and find which one you like!
Sometimes it's easier to set your desired hair color before looking at the options.

If you really can't decide, some popular haircut options include Floorlength Bedhead, Modern, Buisness, CIA or just bald! No shame in being bald.
Don't feel obligated to use any of these, though.

## Jobs
Here you can set your job preferences. While these don't guarantee your position, someone who wants the job will be randomly selected at the start of the round.
You are given a chance at being chosen for your high priority job first, then your medium priorities, then your low priorities.
You also given an option to automatically be a passenger or to be sent back to the lobby if you don't get chosen for any of your preferred jobs.

You may also choose loadouts for each job. Loadouts are the hats, jumpsuits, backpacks and trinkets that you spawn with upon joining the game. Some loadout items are locked behind playtime restrictions.
This may have minor effects on gameplay, as some clothing items have armor protection or slow down your movement speed. This applies especially to heads and security.

You may also choose what bag you spawn in with.
Backpacks are medium sized but can carry large items easier. Satchels have more total space than backpacks but have trouble carrying large items. Duffel bags are large but incur a movement penalty.

Some jobs are locked until you've played long enough as other entry level jobs. Read the Jobs entry for more information.

## Antags
Turning on an antagonist toggle will put you on the list of potentional antags at the start of the round. They do not guarantee your antagonist role, don't use this as an excuse to self-antag!
Instead, like job priorities, a handful of players are chosen randomly from eligible players. If you are a command member or security officer, you cannot be chosen for an antag role.

Joining multiple games or ghosting/disconnecting/commiting suicide upon not being chosen for an antag role is referred to as "antag-rolling" and it is against the rules.
If you are not ready for an antagonist role, do not opt-in for it. It ruins the fun for the people patiently waiting for their turn.

## Traits
Speech traits alter your speech, sometimes to an extreme degree. They include:
- Accentless (disables the accent of your selected species)
- Cowboy accent (word replacement, partner)
- Frontal lisp ("s" is replaced with "th")
- Italian accent (Mamma-mia, word replacement)
- Pathological liar (word replacement, changes words like "yes" to "no")
- Pirate accent (Arrgh, word replacement)
- Social anxiety (s-s-stutter)
- Southern Drawl (replaces "-ing" with "-in'" and similar changes)

You should be comfortable with talking normally or with a minor accent such as Social anxiety or Southern drawl before taking heavy accents like Italian or Cowboy.

There are also disabilty traits. You should be very familiar with the game and the game's flow before taking one of these. They include:
- Blindness (severely limits your vision)
- Lightweight drunk (makes alcohol more potent for you)
- Muted (you cannot talk or whisper, but you can still communicate via emotes and pen and paper)
- Narcolepsy (you randomly fall asleep at unpredictable and often inconvenient times)
- Pacifist (you cannot hit, shoot, or throw things at people)
- Paracusia (you sometimes hear noises that aren't real)
- Short-sighted (somewhat limits your vision without prescription glasses)
- Snoring (you make loud snoring sounds when asleep)
- Unrevivable (you cannot be resusitated when you meet your untimely demise)

## Markings
Markings range from scars and snouts to tattoos and tails. Think of them like accessories that are a part of your body, as they cannot be removed during the round.
This is usually to give your character some extra flair that clothing can't accomplish.
Some species have more marking options than others. Humans are more limited in terms of markings than moths or reptilians.

You can have a set number of markings in each 'category', as seen at the top. For example, reptilians can have one chest marking but two markings on the top of their heads.
These are cosmetic and have no effect on gameplay.

## How to stand out
You don't really need to stand out, but memorable characters are usually remembered for their personality, their deeds and their robustness. Don't sweat having a big, flashy and memorable character.
Become the character and make some memories yourself.
