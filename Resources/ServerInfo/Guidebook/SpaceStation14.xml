  # Space Station 14

  This entry marks the beginning of the advanced guidebook entries. Most information found here only applies to offical Wizard's Den servers, or servers that are similar to it.
  
  If you're just here to play, that's great! The [color=#a4885c]Still new?[/color] section of this entry will help you out, if you're looking to do a bit more with the game, you can join our discord and find our github page in the lobby.

  ## Still new?
  It's a good idea to start in the [color=#a4885c]New? Start here![/color] entry, and then move on to the [color=#a4885c]Roleplaying[/color] and [color=#a4885c]Jobs[/color] guides. Not all jobs or concepts will have guides yet, and it's strongly encouraged to help us write them if you're an experienced player!
