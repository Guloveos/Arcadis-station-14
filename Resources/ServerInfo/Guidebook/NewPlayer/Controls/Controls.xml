## Basic controls
We shall politely assume you already know how WASD to walk works.
Beyond that, there's a handful primary interactions in SS14, ordered by importance:

- [color=#a4885c][keybind="Use"/][/color] to pick up items and activate objects like buttons or computers, and [color=#a4885c][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"/][/color] to activate items. You can also press [color=#a4885c]alt[/color] while doing this to trigger alternate interactions for some objects.
- You can also quickly activate items you're holding by pressing [color=#a4885c][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"/][/color] and [color=#a4885c][keybind="AltActivateItemInHand"/][/color] respectively.
- [color=#a4885c][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/color] to open the context menu. You can then either left click an entry just like you would in the world, or right click it again to open the verb menu, which gives you more complex ways to interact with an object.
- You can [color=#a4885c][keybind="ExamineEntity"/][/color] objects to examine them, and get their name and a detailed (though often humorous) description.

You can quickly try out these controls with the monkey below (note: clicking it only works in-game and not in the lobby), and at any point in this guidebook if you're shown an entity, [color=#a4885c][keybind="ExamineEntity"/] to examine will always work[/color]:

## Inventory
Only one of your hands are 'active', meaning that's the one you'll do things with.

Press [color=#a4885c][keybind="SwapHands"/][/color] to swap your active hand. Press [color=#a4885c][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"/][/color] to use the item in your active hand.

Opening your bag is easy as well, either hover over the item and activate it with [color=#a4885c][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"/][/color] or click on the bag icon in the bottom right corner of the slot it is in.

When you open a container a window will pop up showing the contents of the container and how much space it has available to hold things. All items have an assigned size, some too large to fit into most or all containers.

To drop items, you can press [color=#a4885c][keybind="Drop"/][/color], and to drop them more violently (also known as throwing), you can press [color=#a4885c][keybind="ThrowItemInHand"/][/color].

## Actions
To the left in your HUD there's a bar showing various actions you can take. You can hover over it to read about what it does or click it to invoke the action.

In order to rearrange your actions, simply drag and drop them to other slots, right click to remove them, and press the gear icon at the top of the bar to open a menu to (re)add them.

## Movement
You can walk by pressing [color=#a4885c][keybind="Walk"/][/color]. Walking over puddles will stop you from slipping.

In zero gravity, you can only move if you're close to a wall. You can also throw items to give yourself a bit of propulsion. The more mass of the item you throw, the farther you go.
