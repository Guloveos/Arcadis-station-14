  # Antagonists
  Antagonists are the driving force of every shift.
  They are the catalysts for chaos, conflict and mystery in Space Station 14 that also serve to provide a challenge to Nanotrasen and its [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] force.
  You can expect them to act in violation of Space Law and they're often tasked with objectives that include theft, subterfuge and murder.

  These bad actors are more often than not employed or backed up by the [color=#ff0000]Syndicate[/color], a rival organization to [color=#134975]Nanotrasen[/color] that wants nothing more than to see it burn.

  ## Various Antagonists
  Antagonist roles come with their own special sets of abilities, tools and risks to the station.

  Antagonists can take many forms, like:
  - [textlink="Nuclear operatives, with the goal of infiltrating and destroying the station." link="Nuclear Operatives"]
  - [textlink="Traitors amongst the crew who must assassinate, steal and decieve." link="Traitors"]
  - [textlink="Space Ninjas, masters of espionage and sabotage with special gear." link="SpaceNinja"]
  - [textlink="Revolutionaries who are intent on taking control of the station from the inside." link="Revolutionaries"]
  - [textlink="Zombies that crave the flesh of every crew member and creature on board." link="Zombies"]
  - [textlink="Several non-humanoid creatures, who usually just try to kill any crew they see." link="MinorAntagonists"]
