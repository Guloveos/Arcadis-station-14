  # Revolutionaries
  Viva la revoluci√≥n!

  Revolutionaries are antagonists who are sponsored by the Syndicate who are tasked with taking over the station. They have no fancy gimmicks or cheap tricks, they only have a cause and strength in numbers.

  ## Objectives

  You must cuff, kill, or exile all of the Command staff on station in no particular order. That includes the following:
  - The [color=yellow]Captain[/color]
  - The [color=#9fed58]Head of Personnel[/color]
  - The [color=#cb0000]Head of Security[/color]
  - The [color=#5b97bc]Chief Medical Officer[/color]
  - The [color=#f39f27]Chief Engineer[/color]
  - The [color=#c96dbf]Research Director[/color]
  - The [color=#b18644]Quartermaster[/color]
  
  Remember, your objective is to take over the station and not to destroy it so try to [bold]minimize damage where possible[/bold].

  ## Headrevs & Conversion

  [color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionaries[/color] are chosen at the start of the shift who begin with a [color=cyan]flash[/color] and a pair of [color=cyan]sunglasses[/color].

  You can convert crew members to [color=#ff0000]Revolutionaries[/color] by taking any [bold]flash[/bold] and attacking someone with it using [color=#ff0000]harm mode[/color].
  However, you can't convert your victim if they're wearing [color=cyan]flash protection[/color] such as [bold]sunglasses[/bold] or [bold]welding masks[/bold].

  Another hurdle in your way are pesky [color=cyan]mindshield implanters[/color]. These will:
  - Prevent the implanted person from being converted into a Revolutionary
  - De-convert Revolutionaries, and will make them no longer loyal to your cause
  - Visibly be destroyed upon being implanted into a Head Revolutionary, giving away your cover
  - NOT protect against flash disorientation

  Assume all of [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] and [color=#1b67a5]Command[/color] are implanted already.

  ## Revolutionary

  A [color=#ff0000]Revolutionary[/color] is the result of being converted by a [color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionary[/color]. Revolutionaries are underlings of the Head Revolutionaries and should follow orders given by them and prioritize their well-being over anything else because if the [color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionaries[/color] die the Revolution will fail.
  You can't convert others as a regular revolutionary, only your boss can do that.
