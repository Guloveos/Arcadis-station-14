  Zombies are conversion antagonists that infect all beings that they bite with [color=#7e916e]Romerol[/color], a deadly, contagious virus that can easily spread if not put down.

  ## Inital Infected
  You are patient zero. You have [color=#7e916e]Romerol[/color] in you, and you have a grand desire to share it with every single flesh being you see.

  Upon learning of your infection, [italic]all bets are off[/italic]. You have only so much time before you turn, and you want to [color=cyan]maximize[/color] your chances of taking over the station.
  Use this period of time to prepare weapons, gear, traps-- [bold]Space Law means nothing to you now.[/bold]

  ## Transmission
  Zombies only know how to shamble, bite and throw themselves against electric grilles. Their bite [bold]may not always transmit [color=#7e916e]Romerol[/color][/bold] through heavy layers of clothing, but it'll definitely hurt.

  The undead can also chomp on a crit or dead body to [color=cyan]instantly convert[/color] it to a zombie.

  ## Zombie Attributes
  A zombie can be identified by dark green skin, red eyes, slow movement, rotting smell, and lack of motor functions. They'll also [bold]drop their headset and gloves [/bold]upon turning, and cuffs don't work against their vicious bite.

  Zombies are known for their [color=cyan]resilience[/color] to slashes, bruises, poison and cold. The undead do, however, [bold]take increased burn and shock damage.[/bold] They can survive in a vacuum and do not require food, water, air, or sleep.

  ## Survival
  When the infection sweeps and [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] falls, it's up to the [bold]survivors[/bold] to try and make it to Central Command.

  Constructing [color=cyan]barricades[/color] around departments or [color=cyan]bolting doors[/color] can buy enough time to make weapons, save lives or make a plan.

  Remember that when it really hits the fan, [bold]you've gotta do what you gotta do[/bold] as long as it's not at the expense of fellow survivors.
  [color=cyan]Scavenge[/color] what you need from those who haven't made it.
  
  ## Cure
  [bold]Those who are already undead can only be cured by [color=red]death.[/color][/bold]
  
  If you're infected but not zombified yet, using [color=#86caf7]Ambuzol[/color] will cure you but won't prevent re-infection. [color=#1274b5]Ambuzol Plus[/color] will cure and prevent re-infection only while alive.
