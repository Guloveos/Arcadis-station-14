## Flashes
[color=cyan]Flashes[/color] are a crowd dispersal tool with a large area of effect against those who are not protected.
They can be used [bold]in a large area[/bold] ([color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color]) or [bold]locally[/bold] if you attack somebody with it while [color=red]harm mode[/color] is active. Localized flashes last [color=yellow]2.5[/color] times longer than large area flashes.

[color=#cb0000]Security[/color] and [color=cyan]some[/color] other members of staff have eye protection from flashbangs and flashes.
