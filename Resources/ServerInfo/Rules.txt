1. [b]No Murderbone.[/b] All kills must have a valid reasoning behind them. Self defense, or an argument turned violent are all correct. if you join the server and the first thing you do is attack someone, or come up to a person and vaguely implicate them with some crime and attack them, you're gonna get beaned.

2. [b]Wanton station destruction.[/b] Repeatedly destroying the station on purpose is dumb.

3. [b]Multi-keying.[/b] Joining the server from alt accounts is gay.

4. [b]No ERP.[/b] Go to a degenerate furry server if you want to do that.
