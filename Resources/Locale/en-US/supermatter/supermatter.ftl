supermatter-announcer = Automatic Supermatter Engine

supermatter-announcement-safe = Crystalline hyperstructure returning to safe operating parameters. Failsafe has been disengaged.

supermatter-announcement-danger = Warning! Crystal hyperstructure integrity faltering! Integrity: {$integrity}%

supermatter-announcement-critical = Danger! Crystal hyperstructure integrity reaching critical levels! Integrity: {$integrity}%

supermatter-tamper-begin = You begin to caferully carve a sliver off the supermatter crystal...

supermatter-tamper-end = You're feeling like a god, holding a piece of the supermatter. Or is it all the radiation?

supermatter-announcement-cc-tamper = Our automatic casualty system has detected that the supermatter crystal structural integrity was compromised by an external force! Engineering department, report to the supermatter engine immediately!

supermatter-seconds-before-delam = {$seconds} seconds remain before delamination.

supermatter-announcement-delam = CRYSTAL DELAMINATION IMMINENT. The supermatter crystal has reached critical integrity failure.

supermatter-announcement-delam-default = Level 10 explosion imminent.

supermatter-announcement-delam-singuloose = Singularity formation imminent.

supermatter-announcement-delam-tesla = Compressed energy release imminent.

supermatter-announcement-delam-cascade = Harmonic frequency limits exceeded. Casualty destabilization field could not be engaged.
